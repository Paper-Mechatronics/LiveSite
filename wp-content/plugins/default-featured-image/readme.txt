Add a default featured image to the media settings page

== Description ==

Add a default featured image to the media settings page. This featured image will show up if no featured image is set. Simple as that.

For exceptions and to see which functions to use see the [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/default-featured-image/faq/).

= Suggestions are welcome =
 * Found a bug?
 * Want to help to translate it in your language?
 * Something to be improved?

[Contact me](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/default-featured-image)

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the settings->media page and select an image.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My chosen featured image doesn't show, why isn't it working? =

This plugin can't guarantee that it works. That depends on the themes. Still I want to know if it fails, so [contact me](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/default-featured-image)

= Which functions can I use to display the featured image? =
The plugin uses the default WordPress functions `the_post_thumbnail` or `get_the_post_thumbnail`. `has_post_thumbnail` will always return true. `get_post_thumbnail_id` will return the ID set on the post or the DFI you set.

= Can I exclude a page or give it a different image? =
Yes you can by using the buildin `dfi_thumbnail_id` filter. It will give you the post id which you can use to check against.

**Don't use a featured image on page 23**

    function dfi_skip_page ( $dfi_id, $post_id ) {
      if ( $post_id == 23 ) {
        return 0; // invalid id
      }
      return $dfi_id; // the original featured image id
    }
    add_filter( 'dfi_thumbnail_id', 'dfi_skip_page', 10 , 2 );

**Use a different image for some categories**

The example below only works if the post has 'animals' as a category. Asigning just 'cats' won't work
To do that just don't nest the `if`

    function dfi_category ( $dfi_id, $post_id ) {
      // all which have 'animals' as a category
      if ( has_category( 'animals', $post_id ) ) {

        //sub category
        if ( has_category( 'cats', $post_id ) ) {
          return 7; // cats img
        } else if has_category( 'dogs', $post_id ) {
          return 8; // dogs img
        }

        return 6; // default animals picture
      }
      return $dfi_id; // the original featured image id
    }
    add_filter( 'dfi_thumbnail_id', 'dfi_category', 10, 2 );

**Different image for the posttype 'wiki'**

    function dfi_posttype_book ( $dfi_id, $post_id ) {
      $post = get_post($post_id);
      if ( 'wiki' === $post->post_type ) {
        return 31; // the image id
      }
      return $dfi_id; // the original featured image id
    }
    add_filter( 'dfi_thumbnail_id', 'dfi_posttype_book', 10, 2 );

= Can I change the HTML of the image returned? =
yes you can with the filter `dfi_thumbnail_html`.

	function dfi_add_class($html, $post_id, $default_thumbnail_id, $size, $attr) {
		// add a class to the existing class list
		$attr['class'] .= ' my-class';

		return wp_get_attachment_image( $default_thumbnail_id, $size, false, $attr );
	}
	add_filter( 'dfi_thumbnail_html', 'dfi_add_class', 10, 5 );

== Description ==  

**The #1 Plugin for User-Generated Content!**

User Submitted Posts (USP) adds a frontend form via template tag or shortcode that enables your visitors to submit posts and upload images. Just add the following shortcode to any Post, Page, or Widget:

`[user-submitted-posts]`

That's all there is to it! Your site now can accept user generated content. Everything is super easy to customize via Plugin Settings page. 

The USP Form includes the following fields:

* Name
* URL
* Email
* Post Title
* Post Tags
* Anti-Spam/Captcha
* Post Category
* Post Content
* Image Upload

USP Form fields may be set as required, optional, or disabled. You can set the Post Status of submitted posts as "Draft", "Publish Immediately", or publish after some number of approved posts. 

USP also enables users to upload multiple images when submitting a post. You control the min/max number of images and the min/max number of images that may be submitted.

Pro version includes many, many more features and settings, with unlimited custom forms, infinite custom fields, multimedia file uploads, and much more. [Check it out &raquo;](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/)



== Installation ==

**Installation**

1. Upload the plugin to your blog and activate
2. Visit the USP settings to configure your options

[More info on installing WP plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins)


**Usage**

To display the submission form on any WP Post or Page, add the USP Shortcode:

	[user-submitted-posts]

Or, to display the form anywhere in your theme, add the USP Template Tag:

	<?php if (function_exists('user_submitted_posts')) user_submitted_posts(); ?>


**Customizing the form**

There are three main ways of customizing the form:

* Via plugin settings, you can show/hide fields, configure options, etc.
* Via custom form template (see "Custom Submission Form" for more info)
* By using USP action/filter hooks (advanced):

`Filters:
usp_post_status
usp_post_author
usp_form_shortcode
usp_mail_subject
usp_mail_message
usp_new_post
usp_input_validate

Actions
usp_submit_success
usp_submit_error
usp_insert_before
usp_insert_after
usp_files_before
usp_files_after
usp_current_page`

Check out the [complete list of action hooks for User Submitted Posts](https://perishablepress.com/action-filter-hooks-user-submitted-posts/)

More info about [WordPress Actions and Filters](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API#Hooks.2C_Actions_and_Filters)


**Custom Submission Form**

Out of the box, User Submitted Posts provides a highly configurable submission form. Simply visit the plugin settings to control which fields are displayed, set the Challenge Question, configure submitted images, and much more. 

There are situations, however, where advanced form configuration may be required. In order to allow for this, the USP plugin makes it possible to create a customized submission form. Here are the steps:

1. Copy `usp.css` from `/resources/` and paste into the `/custom/` directory
2. Copy `submission-form.php` from `/views/` and paste into the `/custom/` directory
3. Visit the plugin settings and change "Form style" to "Custom form + CSS"
4. Customize either of the new files as desired, they will not be overwritten when the plugin is updated

Alternately, you can enable the option "HTML5 Form + Disable CSS" to use your own CSS along with the default USP form.

Or, to go further with unlimited custom forms, [check out USP Pro](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/) :)


**Displaying submitted posts**

User-submitted posts are handled by WordPress as regular Posts. So they are displayed along with other posts according to your WP Theme. Additionally, each submitted post includes a set of Custom Fields that include the following information:

* `is_submission` - indicates that the post is a user-submitted post
* `user_submit_image` - the URL of the submitted image (one custom field per image)
* `user_submit_ip` - the IP address of the submitted-post author
* `user_submit_name` - the name of the submitted-post author
* `user_submit_url` - the submitted URL

There are numerous ways to display these Custom Fields. The easiest way is to visit the plugin settings and configure the options available under "Auto-Display Content". There you can enable auto-display of submitted email address, URL, and images. Note that submitted images also are uploaded to the WP Media Library.

For more flexibility, you can use a variety of WP Template Tags (e.g., [get_post_meta()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_post_meta)) to display Custom Fields. Here are some tutorials for more information:

* [WordPress Custom Fields, Part I: The Basics](https://perishablepress.com/wordpress-custom-fields-tutorial/)
* [WordPress Custom Fields, Part II: Tips and Tricks](https://perishablepress.com/wordpress-custom-fields-tips-tricks/)

And here are some tutorials that may help with custom display of submitted images:

* [Display all images attached to post](https://wp-mix.com/display-images-attached-post/)
* [Display images with links](https://wp-mix.com/display-images-with-user-submitted-posts/)

Also, here is a [Helper Plugin to display Custom Fields](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-custom-field-helper-plugin/). It originally is designed for use with USP Pro, but also works great with the free version of USP.


**Auto Display Images**

To automatically display submitted images on the frontend, visit the plugin settings, "Images Auto-Display" and select whether to display the images before or after post content. Save changes.


**Featured Images**

To set submitted images as Featured Images (aka Post Thumbnails) for submitted posts, visit the plugin settings, "Image Uploads" and check the box to enable "Featured Image". Save changes.


**Shortcodes**

User Submitted Posts includes two shortcodes:

* `[user-submitted-posts]` - displays the USP form on any Post or Page
* `[usp_display_posts]` - displays a list of all user-submitted posts

The `[user-submitted-posts]` shortcode does not have any attributes. You simply include it wherever you want to display the form.

The `[usp_display_posts]` shortcode has two optional attributes, "userid" and "numposts". Examples:

* `[usp_display_posts userid="1"]` : displays all submitted posts by registered user with ID = 1
* `[usp_display_posts userid="Pat Smith"]` : displays all submitted posts by author name "Pat Smith"
* `[usp_display_posts userid="all"]` : displays all submitted posts by all users/authors
* `[usp_display_posts userid="all" numposts="5"]` : limit to 5 posts

By default `[usp_display_posts]` displays all submitted posts by all authors. So the attributes can be used to customize as desired.


**Template tags**

USP also includes a set of template tags for customizing and displaying submitted posts:

	/*
		Display the USP Form
		Usage: <?php if (function_exists('user_submitted_posts')) user_submitted_posts(); ?>
	*/
	
	user_submitted_posts()
	
	
	
	/* 
		Check if post is a submitted post
		Returns true or false
		Usage: <?php if (usp_is_public_submission()) return true; ?>
	*/
	
	usp_is_public_submission()
	
	
	
	/* 
		Get all image URLs
		Returns an array of image URLs that are attached to the current submitted post
		Usage: <?php $images = usp_get_post_images(); foreach ($images as $image) echo $image; ?>
	*/
	
	usp_get_post_images()
	
	
	
	/* 
		Display all images
		Outputs a set of <img> tags for images attached to the current submitted post
		Usage: <?php usp_post_attachments($size, $beforeUrl, $afterUrl, $numberImages, $postId); ?>
		Parameters:
			$size         = image size: thumbnail, medium, large or full -> default = full
			$beforeUrl    = text/markup displayed before each image URL  -> default = <img src="
			$afterUrl     = text/markup displayed after each image URL   -> default = " />
			$numberImages = number of images to display for each post    -> default = false (display all)
			$postId       = an optional post ID to use                   -> default = uses global post
	*/
	
	usp_post_attachments()
	
	
	
	/* 
		Display submitted author name and URL
		This tag displays one of the following:
			- The author's submitted name as a link (if both 'User Name' and 'Post URL' fields are included in the form)
			- The author's submitted name as plain text (if 'User Name' is included in the form, but 'Post URL' is not included)
			- The author's registered username as a link to the author's post archive (if 'User Name' is not included in the form)
			
		Usage: <?php usp_author_link(); ?>
	*/
	
	usp_author_link()


These template tags should work out of the box when included in your theme template file(s). Keep in mind that for some of the tags to work, there must be some existing submitted posts and/or images available. 

The source code for these tags is located in `/library/template-tags.php`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Can you add this feature or that feature?**

Please check the [Pro version of USP](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/), which includes many of the most commonly requested features from users. The free version also may include new features in future updates.


**Images are not uploaded or displaying**

If everything is configured properly, USP will display submitted images on the front-end. If that is not happening, here are some things to check:

* Make sure that the setting "Images Auto-Display" is enabled
* And/or make sure that the setting "Featured Image" is enabled
* And/or make sure that your theme is set up to display submitted images

Assuming that everything is set up to display submitted images, here are some further things to check:

* Is there any error message when trying to submit an image? 
* Check that the submitted images are uploaded to the Media Library
* Check that the URL of the submitted image is attached to the submitted post as a Custom Field (on Edit Post screen)
* Check the permission settings on the upload folder(s) by ensuring that you can successfully upload image files directly via the Media Uploader
* Double-check that all the "Image Uploads" settings make sense, and that the images being uploaded meet the specified requirements

Note: when changing permissions on files and folders, it is important to use the least-restrictive settings possible. If you have to use more permissive settings, it is important to secure the directory against malicious activity. For more information check out: [Secure Media Uploads](https://digwp.com/2012/09/secure-media-uploads/)


**How to set submitted image as the featured image?**

Here are the steps:

* Visit USP settings &gt; Options panel &gt; Image Uploads &gt; Featured Image
* Check the box and click "Save Settings" to save your changes

Note that this setting merely assigns the submitted image as the Featured Image; it's up to your theme's single.php file to include `the_post_thumbnail()` to display the Featured Images. If your theme is not so equipped, [check out this tutorial at WP-Mix](https://wp-mix.com/set-attachment-featured-image/).


**How to require login?**

Here is the easiest way of doing it (customize as needed):

`if (is_user_logged_in()) {
	// the user is logged in, so display the submission form
	if (function_exists('user_submitted_posts')) user_submitted_posts();
} else { 
	// the user is not logged in, so do something else
	echo 'Please log in to submit posts!';
}`

Basically what this code does is:

1. Check if the user is logged in, and if so..
2. Display the USP form
3. Else, if the user is not logged in..
4. Do whatever makes sense for your site (e.g., display a message) 

For more information and techniques, check out these tutorials at WP-Mix:

* [Check if user is logged in](https://wp-mix.com/wordpress-check-user-logged-in/)
* [Require user login for any plugin](https://wp-mix.com/require-user-login-any-plugin/)
* [Members-only content via shortcode](https://wp-mix.com/members-only-content-shortcode/)
* [Private notes and members-only content](https://wp-mix.com/private-notes-members-only-content/)
* [WordPress redirect logged in users](https://wp-mix.com/wordpress-redirect-logged-in-users/)
* [WordPress Do Stuff on First User Login](https://wp-mix.com/wordpress-first-user-login/)

Also note: [USP Pro includes built-in shortcodes](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-display-form-logged-in-users/) to display forms and other content to registered/logged-in users and/or guests/logged-out users.


**How do I change the appearance of the submission form?**

The easiest way to customize the form is via the plugin settings. There you can choose one of the following form configurations:

* HTML5 Form + Default CSS (Recommended)
* HTML5 Form + Disable CSS (Provide your own styles)
* Custom Form + Custom CSS (Provide your own form template & styles)

Additionally, you can configure the settings to show/hide specific fields, control the number and size of submitted images, customize the Challenge Question, and much more.

To go beyond what's possible with the plugin settings, USP enables creation of a customized submission form. Here are the steps:

1. Copy `usp.css` from `/resources/` and paste into the `/custom/` directory
2. Copy `submission-form.php` from `/views/` and paste into the `/custom/` directory
3. Visit the plugin settings and change "Form style" to "Custom form + CSS"
4. Customize either of the new files as desired, they will not be overwritten when the plugin is updated

Alternately, you can enable the option "HTML5 Form + Disable CSS" to use your own CSS along with the default form. Then you can customize the form's CSS via `/custom/usp.css` or your theme's `style.css`.

For advanced customization, developers can use [USP action and filter hooks](https://perishablepress.com/action-filter-hooks-user-submitted-posts/).

Or, to go further with unlimited custom forms, [check out USP Pro](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/) :)


**What about security and spam?**

User Submitted Posts uses the WordPress API to keep everything secure, fast, and flexible. The plugin also features a Challenge Question and hidden anti-spam field to stop automated spam and bad bots.


**Can I include video?**

The free version of USP supports uploads of images only, but some hosted videos may be included in the submitted content (textarea) by simply including the video URL on its own line. See [this page](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) for more info. Note that [USP Pro](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro/) enables users to [upload video and much more](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-allowed-file-types/#file-formats).


**How do I reset the plugin settings? Will it erase all of my submitted posts?**

To reset plugin settings to factory defaults:

* Visit "Restore Default Options" in the plugin settings
* Check the box and save your changes
* Deactivate the plugin and then reactivate it
* Plugin settings now are restored to defaults

And no, restoring default settings does not delete any submitted posts. Even if you completely remove the plugin, the submitted posts will not be deleted. You have to remove them manually, if desired.


**Wanted to be sure that the plugin does not require the exec() / exec.php or url_fopen functions, as both of those have been disabled on our host server for security reasons.**

User Submitted Posts does not use any of "the exec() / exec.php or url_fopen functions". So you're good to go.


**The Name and URL fields are not displayed in the form, even though they are set to display in the plugin options.**

The setting "Registered Username" when enabled will automatically hide the Name field. Likewise the setting "User Profile URL" when enabled will automatically hide the URL field. Try enabling these settings and refreshing the form page.


**More Questions &amp; Answers**

__Question:__ "I'm new to wordpress and just installed your plugin User Submitted posts. What template do I add the code to have it work everywhere."

__Answer:__ It really depends on the theme, as each tends to use template files differently.. it also depends on where on the page you would like to display the form, for example the sidebar (sidebar.php), the footer (footer.php), and so forth. Also, chances are that you'll need to add the form to more than one template file, for example index.php and page.php, etc. A good first place to try would be the sidebar, or maybe index.php and then go from there.


__Question:__ "I have the option for multiple image uploads enabled in the plug-in settings however it does not work on the site. When you click on the Add another image text nothing happens."

__Answer:__ The "Add another image" link is dependent on the required JavaScript being included in the page. Check the plugin setting to "Include JavaScript?" and you should be good to go.


__Question:__ "I really like the new Rich Text editor, but the Add Media button only shows up if I'm logged in to the site, and so nobody else can see it. Is there a way to change that so that all readers wanting to submit something can use that button?"

__Answer:__ As far as I know the user must be logged in to have access to file uploads, Media Library and the uploader. This is a security measure aimed at preventing foul play. The Pro version of USP, however, provides an option to [enable Add Media uploads for all user levels](https://plugin-planet.com/usp-pro-enable-non-admin-users-upload-media/).


__Question:__ "I have it set so that articles get submitted under the users name. Sometimes when a user submits an article the article gets submitted under the users name, and other times set as the default user as set in the settings. When the article gets set to the default user I cannot change it in wordpress, I need to copy and paste the whole article to a new article and then set it to the proper user."

__Answer:__ The registered username of the submitter can be used for post author only when the user is logged in to WordPress (otherwise it's impossible for WordPress to know their identity). Thus, to resolve the dilemma posed in the question, one solution is to require users to be logged in to submit posts. See the previous Q&amp;A, "How to require login?". See also the related settings, "Registered Username" and "User Profile URL".


__Question:__ "Can you explains how the setting 'Registered Username' works?"

__Answer:__ Yes, here is a summary:

* When "Registered Username" is enabled:
	* If the user is logged in, their registered username is used as the Post Author
	* If the user is logged out, the setting "Assigned Author" is used as the Post Author
* When "Registered Username" is disabled:
	* The setting "Assigned Author" always is used as the Post Author for all users (whether logged in or not)


__Question:__ "When displaying the post author and author URL for submitted posts, my theme uses the default assigned author. How can I change it so that my theme uses the submitted author name and author URL instead of the default assigned author?"

__Answer:__ This functionality is built in to the Pro version of USP, but it's also possible using either of the following methods:

* Replace your theme's current author tags with USP's `usp_author_link()`
* By adding some custom code to your theme's functions.php file. If interested, please [contact me directly](https://perishablepress.com/contact/) and I will send the code and steps to implement.


__Question:__ "Why doesn't the USP shortcode work when added to the WP Text widget?"

__Answer:__ By default, WordPress does not enable shortcodes in widgets. I have added a plugin setting called "Enable Shortcodes" that will enable any/all shortcodes to work in widgets. Enable that setting and you should be good to go. Note: the "Enable Shortcodes" setting applies to all shortcodes, even those of other plugins. Check out WP-Mix for more information on [enabling shortcodes in widgets](https://wp-mix.com/enable-shortcodes-widgets/).


__Question:__ "How can I translate this plugin?"

__Answer:__ There are many ways to translate, depending on your setup, skill level, etc. The easiest way that I know of is to install and use [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/), which makes translating about as easy as it can be. FYI, USP's translation files are located in the `/languages/` directory.
